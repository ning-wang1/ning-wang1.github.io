This paper is an extension of our INFOCOM 2021 paper, In this paper, we examine three recent AE attacks against ML-based IDSs. The results confirm that the problem-space AE attacks are an effective disruption to the IDSs as it allows malicious events to escape with high probability. We identify common features of successful AEs and based on which we design an effective and accurate AE detector, MANDA. The MANDA system takes on a novel design that exploits inconsistency between manifold evaluation and IDS model inference and evaluates model uncertainty on small perturbations to differentiate AEs from clean network traffic. Our evaluation of MANDA using the NSL-KDD dataset and the CICIDS dataset shows that MANDA outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical test model (i.e., Artifact) by achieving higher AUC scores and higher true-positive rate with a 5% false-positive rate. MANDA also performs well when evaluating using the MNIST dataset, which implies that the detector may be applied to other domains, e.g., the computer vision area..
