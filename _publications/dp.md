title: "Squeezing More Utility via Adaptive Clipping on Deferentially Private Gradients in Federated Meta-Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dp
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new differentially private federated meta-learning architecture to addresses data privacy challenges in federated learning.
Our proposal features an adaptive gradient clipping method and a one-pass meta-training process to improve model utility-privacy trade-off. It provides two notions of privacy protection for the trusted server and honest-but-curious central server.
