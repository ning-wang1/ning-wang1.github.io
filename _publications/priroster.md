collection: publications
permalink: /publication/priroster
excerpt: 'This paper use Trusted execution environment (TEE) To protect a device's configuration information. PriRoster hides sensitive device and/or radio configuration information from untrusted intermediate verifiers in a public network and enables a range of new applications such as efficient network-wide radio context attestation. To improve system scalability and eliminate information side channel leakage, we develop trust transfer protocol and incorporate obliviousness primitive into the attestation program. We build a prototype of the proposed PriRoster system using Raspberry Pi, USRP, Intel NUC, and AWS cloud.'
