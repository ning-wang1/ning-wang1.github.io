title: "PriRoster: Privacy-preserving Radio Context Attestation in Cognitive Radio Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/priroster
excerpt: 'This paper uses trusted execution environment to protect sensitive device and radio configuration information from untrusted intermediate verifiers in a public network. To improve system scalability and eliminate information side channel leakage, we develop trust transfer protocol and incorporate obliviousness primitive into the attestation program.'
