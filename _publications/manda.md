excerpt: 'This paper examines three recent AE attacks against ML-based IDSs. It demonstrate that the problem-space AE attacks are an effective disruption to the IDSs as it allows malicious events to escape with high probability. In this paper, we design an effective and accurate AE detector, MANDA, which exploits inconsistency between manifold evaluation and IDS model inference and evaluates model uncertainty on small perturbations to differentiate AEs from clean network traffic.'
