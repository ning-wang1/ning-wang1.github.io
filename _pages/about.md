I am an assistant professor in the [Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Computing (CAICC)](https://www.usf.edu/ai-cybersecurity-computing/) at the University of South Florida (USF). 

My research interests include federated learning, network intrusion detection, adversarial machine learning, differential privacy, and LLM application in cybersecurity.



## Opening
<span style="color:blue">Multiple PhD Openings (with assistantship): </span> I am looking for self-motivated students with research interests in any area of cybersecurity or the intersection of AI and security. If this opportunity interests you, reach out to me (ningw at usf.edu), providing your resume and any supplementary material that will help me gain insight into your academic background and research expertise.
