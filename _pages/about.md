I am a Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech, working with Prof. Wenjing Lou. I received my B.E. degree in communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2015. I received my M.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering from BUPT in 2018. 
My research interests include anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, and differential privacy.
