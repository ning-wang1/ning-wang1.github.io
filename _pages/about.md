I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/) at the University of South Florida (USF). 

My research interests include federated learning, network intrusion detection, adversarial machine learning, and differential privacy.




<span style="color:blue">Multiple PhD Openings (with assistantship): </span> I am looking for self-motivated students with research interests in any area of cybersecurity or the intersection of AI and security. If this opportunity interests you, reach out to me ([ningw@usf.edu](ningw@usf.edu)), providing your resume and any supplementary material that will help me gain insight into your academic background and research expertise.
